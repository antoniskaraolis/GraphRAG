Although this\nappears to be a most natural approach to risk management too, applications in\ncritical infrastructures often violate the implicit assumption of actions\nleading to deterministic consequences. In that sense, the gameplay in a\ncritical infrastructure risk control competition is intrinsically random in the\nsense of actions having uncertain consequences. Mathematically, this takes us\nto utility functions that are probability-distribution-valued, in which case we\nloose the canonic (in fact every possible) ordering on the space of payoffs,\nand the original techniques of von Neumann and Morgenstern no longer apply.\n  This work introduces a new kind of game in which uncertainty applies to the\npayoff functions rather than the player's actions (a setting that has been\nwidely studied in the literature, yielding to celebrated notions like the\ntrembling hands equilibrium or the purification theorem). In detail, we show\nhow to fix the non-existence of a (canonic) ordering on the space of\nprobability distributions by only mildly restricting the full set to a subset\nthat can be totally ordered.

The mean or median spatial filters\nwith fixed window shape are known for its denoising ability, however, have the\ndrawback of blurring the object edges. The effect of blurring increases with an\nincrease in window size. To preserve the edge information, we propose an\nadaptive spatial filter that uses neuron's ability to detect similar pixels and\ncalculates the mean. The analog input differences of neighborhood pixels are\nconverted to the chain of pulses with voltage controlled oscillator and applied\nas neuron input. When the input pulses charge the neuron to equal or greater\nlevel than its threshold, the neuron will fire, and pixels are identified as\nsimilar. The sequence of the neuron's responses for pixels is stored in the\nserial-in-parallel-out shift register.

Functionally\nsimilar proteins can differ substantially in their robustness to mutations and\ncapacity to evolve new functions, but it has remained unclear whether any of\nthese differences might be due to evolutionary selection for these properties.\n  RESULTS: Here we use laboratory experiments to demonstrate that evolution\nfavors protein mutational robustness if the evolving population is sufficiently\nlarge. We neutrally evolve cytochrome P450 proteins under identical selection\npressures and mutation rates in populations of different sizes, and show that\nproteins from the larger and thus more polymorphic population tend towards\nhigher mutational robustness. Proteins from the larger population also evolve\ngreater stability, a biophysical property that is known to enhance both\nmutational robustness and evolvability. The excess mutational robustness and\nstability is well described by existing mathematical theories, and can be\nquantitatively related to the way that the proteins occupy their neutral\nnetwork.\n  CONCLUSIONS: Our work is the first experimental demonstration of the general\ntendency of evolution to favor mutational robustness and protein stability in\nhighly polymorphic populations. We suggest that this phenomenon may contribute\nto the mutational robustness and evolvability of viruses and bacteria that\nexist in large populations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 14 Apr 2007 19:42:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-16", "authors_parsed": [["Bloom", "Jesse D.", ""], ["Lu", "Zhongyi", ""], ["Chen", "David", ""], ["Raval", "Alpan", ""], ["Venturelli", "Ophelia S.", ""], ["Arnold", "Frances H.", ""]]}

Materials and methods: We have used\nmicroplate spectrophotometry to measure the growth kinetics of hundreds of\nindividual cell clones from the Molt3 cell line. The growth rate of each clonal\npopulation has been estimated by fitting experimental data with the logistic\nequation. Results: The growth rates were observed to vary among different\nclones. Up to six clones with a growth rate above or below the mean growth rate\nof the parent population were further cloned and the growth rates of their\noffsprings were measured. The distribution of the growth rates of the subclones\ndid not significantly differ from that of the parent population thus suggesting\nthat growth variability has an epigenetic origin. To explain the observed\ndistributions of clonal growth rates we have developed a probabilistic model\nassuming that the fluctuations in the number of mitochondria through successive\ncell cycles are the leading cause of growth variability. For fitting purposes,\nwe have estimated experimentally by flow cytometry the maximum average number\nof mitochondria in Molt3 cells. The model fits nicely the observed\ndistributions of growth rates, however, cells in which the mitochondria were\nrendered non functional (rho-0 cells) showed only a 30% reduction in the clonal\ngrowth variability with respect to normal cells. Conclusions: A tumor cell\npopulation is a dynamic ensemble of clones with highly variable growth rate.

However, new protein\nfunctions evolve when selection begins to favor other, \"promiscuous\" functions\nthat are incidental to a protein's biological role. If mutations that are\nneutral with respect to a protein's primary biological function cause\nsubstantial changes in promiscuous functions, these mutations could enable\nfuture functional evolution.\n  RESULTS: Here we investigate this possibility experimentally by examining how\ncytochrome P450 enzymes that have evolved neutrally with respect to activity on\na single substrate have changed in their abilities to catalyze reactions on\nfive other substrates. We find that the enzymes have sometimes changed as much\nas four-fold in the promiscuous activities. The changes in promiscuous\nactivities tend to increase with the number of mutations, and can be largely\nrationalized in terms of the chemical structures of the substrates. The\nactivities on chemically similar substrates tend to change in a coordinated\nfashion, potentially providing a route for systematically predicting the change\nin one function based on the measurement of several others.\n  CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests that initially neutral genetic drift can lead\nto substantial changes in protein functions that are not currently under\nselection, in effect poising the proteins to more readily undergo functional\nevolution should selection \"ask new questions\" in the future.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 May 2007 05:02:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-07-18", "authors_parsed": [["Bloom", "Jesse D", ""], ["Romero", "Philip A", ""], ["Lu", "Zhongyi", ""], ["Arnold", "Frances H", ""]]}

Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a driving\nforce in shaping the topology of molecular networks. In particular it has been\nnoted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferential\nattachment, and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions of\nmolecular networks.\n  Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring by\nincluding directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result of\nunidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes to\nquantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this in\nitself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sites\nin procaryotes. The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degree\ndistribution, p(k)&prop; 1/k^&gamma;, with exponent &gamma;=1 in the\nnon-growing case, and with &gamma;>1 when the network is growing.\n  Conclusions: We find that duplication of genes followed by substantial\nrecombination of upstream regions could generate main features of genetic\nregulatory networks. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broad\nto be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as a\nmain additional constraint on duplicated genes.

The EGM is the simplest model combining the GM with the\nnetwork approach within a maximum-entropy framework. Via a unified and\nprincipled mechanism that is transparent enough to be generalized to any\neconomic network, the EGM provides a new econometric framework wherein trade\nprobabilities and trade volumes can be separately controlled by any combination\nof dyadic and country-specific macroeconomic variables. The model successfully\nreproduces both the global topology and the local link weights of the ITN,\nparsimoniously reconciling the conflicting approaches.

Although\nmany academics, practitioners and policy makers have studied questions related\nto collapsing asset price bubbles, there is little consensus yet about their\ncauses and effects. This review and essay evaluates some of the hypotheses\noffered to explain the market crashes that often follow asset price bubbles.\nStarting from historical accounts and syntheses of past bubbles and crashes, we\nput the problem in perspective with respect to the development of the efficient\nmarket hypothesis. We then present the models based on heterogeneous agents and\nthe limits to arbitrage that prevent rational agents from bursting bubbles\nbefore they inflate. Then, we explore another set of explanations of why\nrational traders would be led to actually profit from and surf on bubbles, by\nanticipating the behavior of noise traders or by realizing the difficulties in\nsynchronizing their actions. We then end by discussing a complex system\napproach of social imitation leading to collective market regimes like herding\nand the phenomenon of bifurcation (or phase transition) that rationalize what\ncrash can occur in unstable market regimes. The key insight is that diagnosing\nbubbles may be feasible when taking into account the positive feedback\nmechanisms that give rise to transient \"super-exponential\" price growth, the\nbubbles.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 12 Dec 2008 18:25:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-15", "authors_parsed": [["Kaizoji", "T.", ""], ["Sornette", "D.", ""]]}

Under his framework, the theoretical optimal allocation\nvector can be very different from the estimated one for large portfolios due to\nthe intrinsic difficulty of estimating a vast covariance matrix and return\nvector. This can result in adverse performance in portfolio selected based on\nempirical data due to the accumulation of estimation errors. We address this\nproblem by introducing the gross-exposure constrained mean-variance portfolio\nselection. We show that with gross-exposure constraint the theoretical optimal\nportfolios have similar performance to the empirically selected ones based on\nestimated covariance matrices and there is no error accumulation effect from\nestimation of vast covariance matrices. This gives theoretical justification to\nthe empirical results in Jagannathan and Ma (2003).

As the constraint on short sales relaxes, the\nnumber of selected assets varies from a small number to the total number of\nstocks, when tracking portfolios or selecting assets. This achieves the optimal\nsparse portfolio selection, which has close performance to the theoretical\noptimal one.

While the existing literature on Bayesian\npartial identification has mostly focused on the structural parameter, our\nprimary focus is on Bayesian credible sets (BCS's) of the unknown identified\nset and the posterior distribution of its support function. We construct a\n(two-sided) BCS based on the support function of the identified set. We prove\nthe Bernstein-von Mises theorem for the posterior distribution of the support\nfunction. This powerful result in turn infers that, while the BCS and the\nfrequentist confidence set for the partially identified parameter are\nasymptotically different, our constructed BCS for the identified set has an\nasymptotically correct frequentist coverage probability. Importantly, we\nillustrate that the constructed BCS for the identified set does not require a\nprior on the structural parameter. It can be computed efficiently for subset\ninference, especially when the target of interest is a sub-vector of the\npartially identified parameter, where projecting to a low-dimensional subset is\noften required. Hence, the proposed methods are useful in many applications.\n  The Bayesian partial identification literature has been assuming a known\nparametric likelihood function. However, econometric models usually only\nidentify a set of moment inequalities, and therefore using an incorrect\nlikelihood function may result in misleading inferences. In contrast, with a\nnonparametric prior on the unknown likelihood function, our proposed Bayesian\nprocedure only requires a set of moment conditions, and can efficiently make\ninference about both the partially identified parameter and its identified set.\nThis makes it widely applicable in general moment inequality models.

Massive MIMO has been\nproved to be a viable technology to achieve these goals by spatially\nmultiplexing several users using many base station (BS) antennas. A potential\nlimitation of Massive MIMO in multicell systems is pilot contamination, which\narises in the channel estimation process from the interference caused by\nreusing pilots in neighboring cells. A standard method to reduce pilot\ncontamination, known as regular pilot (RP), is to adjust the length of pilot\nsequences while transmitting data and pilot symbols disjointly. An alternative\nmethod, called superimposed pilot (SP), sends a superposition of pilot and data\nsymbols. This allows to use longer pilots which, in turn, reduces pilot\ncontamination.

A prominent role in these methods is played by\ncross-validation which compares predictions to actual outcomes in test samples,\nin order to select the level of complexity of the model that provides the best\npredictive power. Our method is closely related, but it differs in that it is\ntailored for predicting causal effects of a treatment rather than a unit's\noutcome. The challenge is that the \"ground truth\" for a causal effect is not\nobserved for any individual unit: we observe the unit with the treatment, or\nwithout the treatment, but not both at the same time. Thus, it is not obvious\nhow to use cross-validation to determine whether a causal effect has been\naccurately predicted. We propose several novel cross-validation criteria for\nthis problem and demonstrate through simulations the conditions under which\nthey perform better than standard methods for the problem of causal effects. We\nthen apply the method to a large-scale field experiment re-ranking results on a\nsearch engine.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 5 Apr 2015 16:01:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 20 Jul 2015 18:24:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2015 18:01:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2022-06-08", "authors_parsed": [["Athey", "Susan", ""], ["Imbens", "Guido", ""]]}

The CQIV estimator is obtained in two stages that are non-additive\nin the unobservables. The first stage estimates a non-additive model with\ninfinite dimensional parameters for the control variable, such as a quantile or\ndistribution regression model. The second stage estimates a non-additive\ncensored quantile regression model for the response variable of interest,\nincluding the estimated control variable to deal with endogeneity. For\ncomputation, we extend the algorithm for CQR developed by Chernozhukov and Hong\n(2002) to incorporate the estimation of the control variable. We give generic\nregularity conditions for asymptotic normality of the CQIV estimator and for\nthe validity of resampling methods to approximate its asymptotic distribution.\nWe verify these conditions for quantile and distribution regression estimation\nof the control variable.

The basic principle behind this approach is called the\nflip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the\nlower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to\nthe positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems):\nspecifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the\nfundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic\ngeometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed\nforms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this\narticle, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that\nthese relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of\nthe preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical\npositivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive\nformulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural\nconstants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These\nturn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the\nKazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the\ncanonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum\ngroups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann\nhypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here,\nin conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs.\nNP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann\nhypothesis over finite fields and related problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Apr 2007 16:41:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 18 May 2007 19:55:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 28 Apr 2008 19:49:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 22 Jan 2009 15:25:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-22", "authors_parsed": [["Mulmuley", "Ketan D.", ""]]}

The resonant poles of each SE circulator\nare modulated in time with 120 deg phase-shifted periodic signals, resulting in\nsynthetic angular-momentum biasing achieved through spatiotemporal modulation\n(STM). We tailor the two SE circulators to exhibit a constant 180 deg phase\ndifference between their STM biases. Unlike conventional differential\ntime-variant circuits, for which only the even or odd spurs are rejected, we\nshow that the proposed configuration cancels out all intermodulation (IM)\nproducts, thus making them operate alike linear time-invariant (LTI) circuits\nfor an external observer. In turn, this property enhances all metrics of the\nresulting circulator, overcoming the limitations of SE architectures, and\nimproving insertion loss, impedance matching, bandwidth and noise figure. We\nshow that this differential architecture also significantly relaxes the\nrequired modulation parameters, both in frequency and amplitude. We develop a\nrigorous small-signal model to guide the design of the proposed circuits and to\nget insights into their pseudo-LTI characteristics. Then, we validate the\ntheory with simulations and measurements showing remarkable performance\ncompared to the current state of the art of magnetless non-reciprocal devices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Sep 2017 00:24:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 9 Aug 2018 02:07:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-10", "authors_parsed": [["Kord", "Ahmed", ""], ["Sounas", "Dimitrios L.", ""], ["Al\u00f9", "Andrea", ""]]}
