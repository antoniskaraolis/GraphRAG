The\nbrightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overall\nperiodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than\nhalf the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not as\nclearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic component\nis not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement with\npredictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar to\nthose of UZ Tau E, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur from\ncircumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending the\ntimescale over which they might form planets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Apr 2007 03:05:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 3 May 2007 15:56:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Jensen", "Eric L.

We\nprove that GBMM is superior to BBS in terms of SE and can break through the\nwell known `upper bound'. That is, GBMM renews the upper bound of the SE. We\ninvestigate SE-oriented precoder activation probability optimization,\nfully-digital precoder design, optimal power allocation and hybrid precoder\ndesign for GBMM. A gradient ascent algorithm is developed to find the optimal\nsolution, which is applicable in all signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regimes. The\nbest solution is derived in the high SNR regime. Additionally, we investigate\nthe hybrid receiver design and deduce the minimum number of receive RF chains\nconfigured to gain from GBMM in achievable SE. We propose a coding approach to\nrealize the optimized precoder activation. An extension to mmWave broadband\ncommunications is also discussed. Comparisons with the benchmark (i.e., WF-MIMO\nchannel capacity) are made under different system configurations to show the\nsuperiority of GBMM.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Oct 2018 05:33:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-26", "authors_parsed": [["Guo", "Shuaishuai", ""], ["Zhang", "Haixia", ""], ["Zhang", "Peng", ""], ["Zhao", "Pengjie", ""], ["Wang", "Leiyu", ""], ["Alouini", "Mohamed-Slim", ""]]}

Many phylogenetic models are often at stake and\ndifferent approaches are used to compare them within a Bayesian framework. The\nBayes factor, defined as the ratio of the marginal likelihoods of two competing\nmodels, plays a key role in Bayesian model selection. We focus on an\nalternative estimator of the marginal likelihood whose computation is still a\nchallenging problem. Several computational solutions have been proposed none of\nwhich can be considered outperforming the others simultaneously in terms of\nsimplicity of implementation, computational burden and precision of the\nestimates. Practitioners and researchers, often led by available software, have\nprivileged so far the simplicity of the harmonic mean estimator (HM) and the\narithmetic mean estimator (AM). However it is known that the resulting\nestimates of the Bayesian evidence in favor of one model are biased and often\ninaccurate up to having an infinite variance so that the reliability of the\ncorresponding conclusions is doubtful. Our new implementation of the\ngeneralized harmonic mean (GHM) idea recycles MCMC simulations from the\nposterior, shares the computational simplicity of the original HM estimator,\nbut, unlike it, overcomes the infinite variance issue.

By extracting multiple centrality features from a network for\ndimensionality reduction, we are able to track the network dynamics underlying\nan intrinsic low-dimensional manifold. Moreover, we employ von Neumann graph\nentropy (VNGE) to measure the information divergence between networks over\ntime. In particular, we propose an asymptotically consistent estimator of VNGE\nso that the cubic complexity of VNGE is reduced to quadratic complexity that\nscales more gracefully with network size. Finally, the effectiveness of our\napproaches is demonstrated through a real-life application of cyber intrusion\ndetection.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 17 Feb 2018 15:35:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-20", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Sijia", ""], ["Chen", "Pin-Yu", ""], ["Rajapakse", "Indika", ""], ["Hero", "Alfred", ""]]}

This allows estimating the\nimpact of CERN on the hazard to file a patent for the first time and on the\nnumber of patent applications, as well as the time needed for these effects to\nshow up. We find that a \"CERN effect\" does exist: being an industrial partner\nof CERN is associated with an increase in the hazard to file a patent for the\nfirst time and in the number of patent applications. These effects require a\nsignificant \"gestation lag\" in the range of five to eight years, pointing to a\nrelatively slow process of absorption of new ideas.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 May 2019 09:36:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-24", "authors_parsed": [["Bastianin", "Andrea", ""], ["Castelnovo", "Paolo", ""], ["Florio", "Massimo", ""], ["Giunta", "Anna", ""]]}

To overcome this problem, the concept of pair\ncopula constructions has been successfully applied to distributional copulas.\nIn this paper, we develop the pair construction for Levy copulas (PLCC).\nSimilar to pair constructions of distributional copulas, the pair construction\nof a d-dimensional Levy copula consists of d(d-1)/2 bivariate dependence\nfunctions.

Since\nthere is a growing demand for prediction of total reserves for different types\nof claims or even multiple lines of business, a time-varying copula framework\nfor granular reserving will be established.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Jan 2018 15:25:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Maciak", "Mat\u00fa\u0161", ""], ["Okhrin", "Ostap", ""], ["Pe\u0161ta", "Michal", ""]]}

The first method is based on tabling and\nwe modified the proof theory to table calls and answers on states (practically,\nequivalent to dynamic programming). The call-answer table is indexed on the\ncall and a signature of the state in which the call was made. The answer\ncolumns contain the answer unification and a signature of the state after the\ncall was executed. The states are signed efficiently using a technique based on\ntries and counting. The second method is based on incremental evaluation and it\napplies when the data oracle contains derived relations. The deletions and\ninsertions (executed in the transaction oracle) change the state of the\ndatabase. Using the heuristic of inertia (only a part of the state changes in\nresponse to elementary updates), most of the time it is cheaper to compute only\nthe changes in the state than to recompute the entire state from scratch. The\ntwo methods are complementary by the fact that the first method optimizes the\nevaluation when a call is repeated in the same state, and the second method\noptimizes the evaluation of a new state when a call-state pair is not found by\nthe tabling mechanism (i.e. the first method).

The IR through mm\nspectral energy distribution can be approximated by a two-temperature model (25\nand 63 K) with a total luminosity of approximately log(L/Lsun)=5.2. Previous\nsubmm imaging resolved this region into a cluster of 5 dust cores, one of which\nis associated with the UCHII region G23.96+0.15, and another with an H2O maser.\nIn our new 2.7 mm continuum image, only the UCHII region is detected, with\ntotal flux and morphology in good agreement with the free-free emission in VLA\ncm-wave maps. For the other four objects, the nondetections at 2.7 mm and in\nthe MSX mid-IR bands are consistent with cool dust emission with a temperature\nof 13-40K and luminosity of 1000-40000 Lsun. By combining single-dish and\ninterferometric data, we have identified over two dozen virialized C18O cores\nin this region that contain ~40% of the total molecular gas mass present.

A crucial feature of\nthis formulation is that it doesn't encode support restrictions on the\nunknowns, unlike most prior work on BD. The indeterminacy inherent to BD, which\nis difficult to resolve with a traditional L1 penalty on the impulse responses,\nis resolved in our method because it seeks a first approximation where the\nimpulse responses are: \"maximally white\" -- encoded as the energy focusing near\nzero lag of the impulse-response auto-correlations; and \"maximally\nfront-loaded\" -- encoded as the energy focusing near zero time of the impulse\nresponses. Hence we call the method focused blind deconvolution (FBD). The\nfocusing constraints are relaxed as the iterations progress. Note that FBD\nrequires the duration of the channel outputs to be longer than that of the\nunknown impulse responses.\n  A multichannel blind deconvolution problem that is appropriately formulated\nby sparse and front-loaded impulse responses arises in seismic inversion, where\nthe impulse responses are the Green's function evaluations at different\nreceiver locations, and the operation of a drill bit inputs the noisy and\ncorrelated source signature into the subsurface.

Still this\nfundamental frequency is not only present at the bark band holding the\nrespective best frequency of this fundamental frequency, but rather at all bark\nbands driven by the tone complex partials. This is caused by drop-outs in the\nbasically regular, periodic spike train in the respective bands. These\ndrop-outs are caused by the energy distribution in the wave form, where time\nspans of low energy are not able to drive spikes. The presence of the\nfundamental periodicity in all bark bands can be interpreted as pitch. Contrary\nto pitch, timbre is represented as a wide distribution of different ISIs over\nbark bands. The definition of pitch is shown to also works with residue\npitches. The spike drop-outs in times of low energy of the wave form also cause\nundertones, integer multiple subdivisions in periodicity, but in no case\novertones can appear.

Methods: In this work, we\npropose a waveform-based hierarchical Artificial Neural Network - Long Short\nTerm Memory (ANN-LSTM) model for BP estimation. The model consists of two\nhierarchy levels, where the lower hierarchy level uses ANNs to extract\nnecessary morphological features from ECG and PPG waveforms and the upper\nhierarchy level uses LSTM layers to account for the time domain variation of\nthe features extracted by lower hierarchy level. Results: The proposed model is\nevaluated on 39 subjects using the Association for the Advancement of Medical\nInstrumentations (AAMI) standard and the British Hypertension Society (BHS)\nstandard. The method satisfies both the standards in the estimation of systolic\nblood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). For the proposed\nnetwork, the mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE)\nfor SBP estimation are 1.10 and 1.56 mmHg, respectively, and for DBP estimation\nare 0.58 and 0.85 mmHg, respectively. Conclusion: The performance of the\nproposed hierarchical ANN-LSTM model is found to be better than the other\nfeature engineering-based networks.

We use the expected number of jump misclassifications as the\nobjective function to optimally select the threshold parameter of the jump\ndetection scheme. We prove that the objective function is quasi-convex and\nobtain a new second-order infill approximation of the optimal threshold in\nclosed form. The approximate optimal threshold depends not only on the spot\nvolatility, but also the jump intensity and the value of the jump density at\nthe origin. Estimation methods for these quantities are then developed, where\nthe spot volatility is estimated by a kernel estimator with thresholding and\nthe value of the jump density at the origin is estimated by a density kernel\nestimator applied to those increments deemed to contain jumps by the chosen\nthresholding criterion. Due to the interdependency between the model parameters\nand the approximate optimal estimators built to estimate them, a type of\niterative fixed-point algorithm is developed to implement them. Simulation\nstudies for a prototypical stochastic volatility model show that it is not only\nfeasible to implement the higher-order local optimal threshold scheme but also\nthat this is superior to those based only on the first order approximation\nand/or on average values of the parameters over the estimation time period.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Nov 2018 04:46:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 11 Sep 2019 05:10:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 2 Mar 2020 03:08:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 4 Apr 2020 05:42:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Figueroa-L\u00f3pez", "Jos\u00e9 E.", ""], ["Li", "Cheng", ""], ["Nisen", "Jeffrey", ""]]}

The importance is therefore determined by a joint calculation of\nthe individual variance contributions and Bayesian relevance using locally\nregularized orthogonal forward regression (LROFR) algorithm.

Segmentation of brain\nimagery into brain tissue and CSF (before and after surgery, i.e. pre-op vs.\npostop) plays a crucial role in evaluating surgical treatment. Segmentation of\npre-op images is often a relatively straightforward problem and has been well\nresearched. However, segmenting post-operative (post-op) computational\ntomographic (CT)-scans becomes more challenging due to distorted anatomy and\nsubdural hematoma collections pressing on the brain. Most intensity and feature\nbased segmentation methods fail to separate subdurals from brain and CSF as\nsubdural geometry varies greatly across different patients and their intensity\nvaries with time. We combat this problem by a learning approach that treats\nsegmentation as supervised classification at the pixel level, i.e. a training\nset of CT scans with labeled pixel identities is employed. Methods: Our\ncontributions include: 1.) a dictionary learning framework that learns class\n(segment) specific dictionaries that can efficiently represent test samples\nfrom the same class while poorly represent corresponding samples from other\nclasses, 2.) quantification of associated computation and memory footprint, and\n3.) a customized training and test procedure for segmenting post-op\nhydrocephalic CT images. Results: Experiments performed on infant CT brain\nimages acquired from the CURE Children's Hospital of Uganda reveal the success\nof our method against the state-of-the-art alternatives. We also demonstrate\nthat the proposed algorithm is computationally less burdensome and exhibits a\ngraceful degradation against number of training samples, enhancing its\ndeployment potential.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Dec 2017 19:24:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-11", "authors_parsed": [["Cherukuri", "Venkateswararao", ""], ["Ssenyonga", "Peter", ""], ["Warf", "Benjamin C.", ""], ["Kulkarni", "Abhaya V.", ""], ["Monga", "Vishal", ""], ["Schiff", "Steven J.", ""]]}
